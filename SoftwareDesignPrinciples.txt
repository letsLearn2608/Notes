Software Design Principles 👇

[1.] KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- Software should be as simple as possible.
- Use clear and concise code, avoid unnecessary complexity, and focus on the essential features.

[2.] DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Code should not be duplicated.
- Use functions and classes to encapsulate common code.
- Use variables and constants to store values that are used in multiple places.

[3.] YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It)
- Don't add extra features to software that you don't need.
- Keep the software simple and maintainable.

[4.] SOLID
- Single Responsibility Principle - A class should have only one responsibility.
- Open/Closed Principle - Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- Liskov Substitution Principle - Objects of a derived class should be substitutable for objects of the base class.
- Interface Segregation Principle - Clients should not be forced to depend on methods that they do not use.
- Dependency Inversion Principle - Dependencies should be injected into a class rather than being hard-coded.

[5.] Principle of Least Astonishment/Surprise
- Design software in a way that is consistent with the user's expectations.
- Use familiar terminology and conventions, and provide clear and concise instructions.
- Use proper and concise error messages.

[6.] Principle of Modularity
- Design software as a collection of independent modules.
- This can help to make the software easier to understand, maintain, and test.

[7.] Principle of Abstraction
- Design software by hiding the implementation details from the user.
- This can help to make the software easier to understand and use.

[8.] Principle of Encapsulation
- Software should be designed to hide the internal state of an object from the outside world.
- This can help to make the software more robust and maintainable.

[9.] Principle of Least Knowledge
- Software should be designed to minimize the amount of knowledge that a module needs about other modules.
- This can help to make the software more modular and flexible.

[10.] Principle of Low Coupling & High Cohesion
- Coupling refers to the degree to which the elements of a module depend on each other.
- A module with low coupling has few dependencies and its elements do not depend on each other too much.

- Cohesion refers to the degree to which the elements of a module belong together.
- A module with high cohesion has a single, well-defined purpose and all of its elements are related to that purpose.
